# Dnty
VERSION 0.5

## About
Hello, I'm JosephcatZ, I *LOVE* tabletop rpgs, but there is a problem.
You see, normally, you need a lot of dice, alot of paper, and alot of pencils, but, whatdo you do if you are playing online, how do you trust their die rolls. So, instead of using roll20, or something like that, where we woudneed to make acounts and stuff, I decided to make this: Dnty

## How to Use
Currently, you need to install processing, and run it, at this time, there is no streaming to a wbsite, but i plan to add that eventualy, link will be here <INSERT LINK HERE> for the streaming site.

## Controls
Click on a character to select it
  Use i to add 10 health
  Use k to take away 10 health
  Move the mouse to move the character
  Release the mouse to drop the character
